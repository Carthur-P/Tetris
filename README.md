# Gameplay
This game plays similarly to any other version of Tetris where the aim is to stack up the Tetris blocks to fill up the entire row of the board. If the player can fill up an entire row of the board, they will be awarded 10 points. This row will now be cleared and the remaining staked blocks will move down to the bottom of the board. If the blocks stack up to the top of the board, the game will end and the tally of the score will be displayed. The player can control the movement/placement of the Tetris blocks using the arrow keys

- __Left arrow:__ move block left
- __Right arrow:__ move block right
- __Down arrow:__ move block down
- __Up arrow:__ rotate block
